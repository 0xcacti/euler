## Project Euler Solution 

Solving some problems in common lisp (at least at first), 
as a way to get comfortable with the language.  Obviously,
syntax is a bit of a hurdle, so I will be using project 
euler as a way to get experience with some of the looping 
and scoping and variable and datastructure constructs of 
the language.  I may continue on and use this for other 
languages but this is what I'm using it for right now.
